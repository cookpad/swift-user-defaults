public extension UserDefaults {
    /// An alias for a type used to represent the key of a user default value.
    ///
    /// # Usage
    ///
    /// This type can be used as a namespace for defining type-safe key definitions within your own code.
    /// Simply create an extension and define your own static properties:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// import SwiftUserDefaults
    ///
    /// extension UserDefaults.Key {
    ///     /// The current state of a user
    ///     static let userState = Self("user_state")
    ///
    ///     // ...
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// You can then use your custom defined keys with other API provided by SwiftUserDefaults:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// import SwiftUserDefaults
    /// import UIKit
    ///
    /// enum UserState: String {
    ///     case idle, onboarding, active
    /// }
    ///
    /// class ViewController: UIViewController {
    ///     @UserDefault(.userState, defaultValue: .idle)
    ///     var userState: UserState
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Or you can access the underlying value using the `rawValue` property should you need to:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// import Foundation
    /// import SwiftUserDefaults
    ///
    /// let rawValue = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: UserDefaults.Key.userState.rawValue)
    /// ```
    struct Key: RawRepresentable, Hashable {
        /// The underlying string value that is used for assigning a value against within the user defaults.
        public let rawValue: String

        public init(rawValue: String) {
            self.rawValue = rawValue
        }

        public init(_ rawValue: String) {
            self.rawValue = rawValue
        }
    }
}
